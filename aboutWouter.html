          <h1>More About Me</h1>
          <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
          <p>I love to hangout with friends. It could be to have drinks, play Magic the Gathering or do something sporty.</p>
          <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
          <p>For me, being able to create something digital is a must. I would love to be a graphic or webdesigner in a small webagency.</p>
          <h2>What is for you your future city?</h2>
          <p>
                For me, the most important thing in a city is that it's selfproviding in all ways. Sustainable energy, food and water. Easy ways of high capacity public transport and a lot of green.
                Cities should be a the perfect mix of everything you need. Both modern and with big buildings, but also with a lot of nature and parks. A mix of all types of people and cultures.
