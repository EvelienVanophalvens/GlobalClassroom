          <h1>More About Me</h1>
          <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
          <p>My most favorite hobbie is fitness. Besides fitness I also love cars.</p>
          <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
          <p>My dream job is being a full-stack developer for a samller company. Besides that I want to have a small company of my own one day.</p>
          <h2>What is for you your future city?</h2>
          <p>
                In my ideal future city, cool schools are all over, making learning accessible and exciting for everyone. 
                The city's packed with green - trees, parks, and gardens are everywhere, making it feel like a giant outdoor living room. 
                Cars haven't disappeared; they're still around, but thanks to smart traffic management and wide, well-planned roads, traffic jams are a thing of the past. 
                We've got clean air too. It's the perfect place for me to keep learning, enjoy nature, and drive around without ever getting stuck in traffic.
